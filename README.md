# Pizzeria

I created this project to develop my skills on the MEAN stack. Pizzeria allows users to order pizza from a predefined list or customize their pizza using a variety of ingredients. Users can then proceed to checkout and view the total bill based on their selections.

## Installation

The project is divided into two main folders: `backend` and `frontend`. Navigate to each folder and run the following command to install dependencies:

```bash
# Install dependencies for backend
cd backend
npm install

# Install dependencies for frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```
## Usage

- Install MongoDB and set up the database connection by configuring the URL in backend/db.js.

- Populate the database with data based on the model files within the backend/model folder.

- Run the backend server:

      cd backend
      node app.js
    
- Ensure you see the "Connection successful" message in the terminal.

- Launch the Angular frontend:

      cd ../frontend
      ng serve -o
  
- Open the provided URL in the terminal to access the frontend
